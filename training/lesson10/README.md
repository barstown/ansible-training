## Resources

In order to assist this laboratory implementation, a set of resources have been added:

-   httpd.conf (Default Apache configuration file in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8)
-   index.html (Basic HTML document structure)

## Steps 

-   Create an inventory file named "inventory" with a group named "myinstance" and include localhost
-   Create a playbook named "templates-playbook.yml" using "myinstance" as a hosts parameter. The playbook should use tasks to ensure that the following conditions are met on the managed hosts:
    -   Define an variable named "file_contents" which contains the a string of "hello world!"
    -   Copy the provided "file.txt.j2" template to your home directory
-   Before running your playbook, run the ansible-playbook --syntax-check  command to verify that its syntax is correct
-   Run the playbook!
-   Test the apache server
